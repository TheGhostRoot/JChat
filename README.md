### JCoreChat

Open-source social media application with customazation and everything you need to host it without knowing how to code. My first atempt was the YT-Downloader, but I want to go bigger and better so Welcome to JCoreChat.

**J** stands for Java, because Java will be the most used language for the project
**Core** means that the whole social media application with all the customazation is open-source and everyone from anywhere can make it batter
**Chat** because it is a social media platfort after all

### Plans

* It can use SQL and NoSQL for database
* Dockerfiles for easier and faster deployment
* .drawio files to explain how everything was planned with drawings
* Make sure every single feature can be custom in the config
* Make it easy to setup if any company wants to host it
* Make sure that everything is safe, secure and protected for both client and backed servers
* Make sure to make good and readable built-in docs for it so devs won't be confused
* The project will be free and open-source until I get paid to make it private
