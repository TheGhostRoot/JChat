### JCoreChat

Template for chat application REST API with database.

**J** stands for Java, because Java will be the most used language for the project

**Core** means that it is open-source

**Chat** because it is made for social media platform after all

### Plans

* It can use **SQL** and **NoSQL** for database. Tested databases: PostgresSQL, MongoDB, MySQL  | I wanted to add ScyllaDB, but it is too confusing.
* .drawio files to explain how everything was planned with drawings ONLY for the network part
* Make sure that everything is safe, secure and protected for both client and backed servers
* Make sure to make good and readable built-in docs for it so devs won't be confused
* Note that this API is made with mind that it won't be used by community bot developers and only by the application itself.
